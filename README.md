#stressKiller
######A small script that randomly downloads a song from a "special" playlist, plays it, and erases it.

When you're tired of working hard and you start drifting away, sometimes all you need is that pop song that plays in the radio all the time... You know people will judge you if they catch you listen to that. But it's stronger than you.
This script comes to the rescue of all you music lovers with those guilty pleasure songs. Just type in stressKiller and let it take you to that special place with the benefit of having no evidence afterwards of the inocent crime.

**Dependencies(the things you need to run this)**:
- youtube-dl
- ffmpeg

**Intructions**:
- Just save the script in a folder that is in your $PATH
- Make it executable
- Run it (only when needed of course)

**TODO**:
- arguments, so you can: 
  - add your personnal playlist
  - add a gold song to play even if offline
